A SMT-LIB 2.6 parsing/formatting library for Rust.
The goal is to comply with the
[official specification](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.6-r2017-07-18.pdf)
of the language.

It can be used to create your own SMT-LIB compliant solver,
or to interact with existing solvers.

There is still some work to do to cover the whole language.
The crate is no longer actively developed, but new features can be added on demand.
If some part of the language you need is not handled, please open an issue.
New contributions are welcome.
